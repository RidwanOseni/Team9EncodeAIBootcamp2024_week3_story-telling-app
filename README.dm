Experimentation

Test how each model incorporates your custom characters.
Observe differences in storytelling style and character development.
Note how the context window size affects the story's coherence and detail.
Notes
API Key Security

Ensure your OpenAI API key is kept secure and not exposed publicly.
Do not commit .env.local or any files containing your API key to version control.
Limitations

The app depends on the availability and performance of OpenAI's API.
Some models (like GPT-4) may have usage limitations or require special access.
Error Handling

If the story generation fails, check your internet connection and API key validity.
Review the console for any error messages.
Customization
